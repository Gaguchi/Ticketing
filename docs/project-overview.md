## What Makes This Different

### 1. Dual Priority System

Two-dimensional priority classification for accurate ticket management:

- **Urgency**: Timeline sensitivity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Importance**: Business impact level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

**Examples:**

- Critical Urgency + Critical Importance: Production server down → All agents notified
- Critical Urgency + Low Importance: Minor UI typo → Quick fix when available
- Low Urgency + Critical Importance: Planned infrastructure upgrade → Important but scheduled

### 2. Timeline-Based Communication

Chronological conversation view with clear message distinction:

- User messages: Left-aligned
- Agent responses: Right-aligned (public)
- Internal notes: Right-aligned (private)
- System events: Center-aligned

Clean, functional interface focused on information density and clarity.

### 3. Automated Email Integration

Seamless email-to-ticket workflow:

- Incoming email → Automatic ticket creation
- Reply email → Updates existing ticket (intelligent threading)
- Agent response → Automatic email delivery
- Complete conversation history in unified timeline

### 4. Flexible Customer Management

Multi-tenant architecture supporting:

- **B2B**: Company-based user groups with shared visibility
- **B2C**: Individual customer accounts
- Unified system with role-based access control

---

## System Workflow

### Customer Journey

1. Customer sends email or submits web form
2. System creates ticket automatically
3. Ticket assigned to agent (manual or rule-based)
4. Agent responds (customer receives email notification)
5. Conversation continues in ticket timeline
6. Issue resolved, ticket closed
7. Auto-archive after configured period

### Support Agent Workflow

1. Receive notification (email/in-app)
2. Review ticket in timeline view
3. Add internal notes for team collaboration
4. Respond to customer (public comment)
5. Update status, urgency, importance, assignments
6. Mark resolved when complete

## Intelligent Features

### Automation Engine

Rule-based workflow automation:

- If ticket unassigned for 2 hours → Notify supervisor

### SLA Management

Automated service level tracking:

- First response time monitoring
- Resolution time tracking
- Deadline warnings and breach alerts

### Query-Based Filtering

Advanced search with natural language syntax:
