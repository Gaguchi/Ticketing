# Ticket Creation Modal Fix

## Problem

The Create Ticket modal was not functional because:

1. The `project` field was required by the backend but not being sent
2. The modal was using a hardcoded dummy project
3. No connection to the actual user's current project

## Solution

### 1. Updated CreateTicketData Interface

Added `project` field to the interface in `ticket.service.ts`:

```typescript
export interface CreateTicketData {
  // ... other fields
  project: number; // âœ… Added - required by backend
}
```

### 2. Load Current Project from localStorage

The modal now loads the user's current project from localStorage (set during ProjectSetup):

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (open) {
    const projectData = localStorage.getItem("currentProject");
    if (projectData) {
      const project = JSON.parse(projectData);
      setCurrentProject(project);
      form.setFieldValue("project", project.id);
    }
  }
}, [open, form]);
```

### 3. Display Real Project Info

The Space dropdown now shows the actual project details:

- Project key (e.g., "TICK")
- Project name (e.g., "Tickets")
- Dynamic icon based on project key

### 4. Include Project in API Call

When creating a ticket, the project ID is now included:

```typescript
const ticketData: CreateTicketData = {
  // ... other fields
  project: currentProject.id,
};
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Login** as a user who has already created a project
2. **Open Dashboard** (you should be automatically redirected here if you have projects)
3. **Click "Create Task"** button in any column
4. **Fill in the form**:
   - Summary: "Test ticket creation"
   - Description: "Testing the fixed modal"
   - Leave other fields as default
5. **Click "Create"**

The ticket should be created successfully and appear in the selected column!
